A world where a collection of plants compete for light resource to grow.

World: n x m grid containing locations of all plant parts. Bounded on all sides with min(y) representing the ground.

Plant: A simple organism
1). Has a root part anchored to the ground of the world X
2). Collects LIGHT through leaf-like projections X
3). Has the capability to grow and expand using LIGHT as the necessary resource

LIGHT:
1). Bounces around in and out of the world plane X
2). More intense coming from the top of the world down, yielding more light to the first
plant encountered

Grow:
1). Parts may change in size / shape
2). New parts may be added or grow
3). Parts may be removed or fall off
4). New plants could be spawned
